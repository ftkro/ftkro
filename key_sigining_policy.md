# Key Signing Policy
Unless there has an additional agreement between the signer and me or bounded by other rules by key signing party organizer, here's my practice for that matter.

## All levels
- I will encrypt my signed key by using your public key and send it to you that is associated with your key to verify its email address.
- Before the signing, I may ask you to send me your key fingerprint.

## 1. Not enough for calculation
- Not meeting with any of the requirements for level 2,3,4,5
- But anyhow, you have to show at least one form of government or accredited school or a well-known corporate ID.  
Otherwise, I will not be able to sign it for you.

## 2. Never trust
**I MAY NOT USE THIS CONTEXT**  
(A below statement will enforce if it's genuinely needed. Usually, I will not sign to those people)
- Presenting any fake, forged, or altered ID and failed to present any valid ID that belongs to you.  
I may also take any legal action, including contact with law enforcement, if it's needed.

## 3. Marginal trust
- Showing two forms of government-issued ID (both IDs must have a photo).  
If you reside in the U.S., This could be replaced by showing one form of government-issued **Real** ID (defined by the Real ID Act).  
I may use UV light, NFC Scanner (I may ask you to enter your PIN code), or barcode scanner to verify its' accuracy.  
I might also ask you a couple of questions to verify that it belongs to you.

## 4. Full trust
To receive this trust level from me, you need to fulfill those requirements that shown below:
- All requirements from the marginal trust level.
- You've already signed my key with at least of marginal trust level.
- I've already met you at least three times on different days, and possibly, other places and different occasions.  
You can request to waive this rule if your key has one fully trust or three marginal trusts from the third party.  
However, I have sole discretion whether I will approve your request or not and reserve a right not to disclose any reason regarding the decision.
- Receive your contact information and pass its verification.  
If possible, I may verify the employer you've stat by making a phone call.
- Present utility bill (including bank statements. Not applicable if you are a resident of Japan)  
or certificate of residence (only if you are a resident of Japan. a.k.a. 住民票)  
or I've visited the premise that you've claimed
And that matched with your address that stated in the ID.
- Being trustworthy. This definition will include not being hostile but friendly to me. (Optional, but strongly recommended)
- Using a secure environment for GPG signing is necessary for this level.
- Having a verifiable digital identity at some online place may help to evaluate the trust level. (Optional)

## 5. Ultimate trust
This trust level does not apply to anyone but me.
That means if the key owner has their secret key by myself and to sign themselves, they can use this level, but not for anyone else.
