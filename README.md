### Hi there üëã
My name is **Takuro Fukuda**. He-him-his. Born in 1999. As of November 4th, 2020, I'm studying Bachelor Science of Information Technology at the University of Cincinnati with enrolling in the University Honors Program and the IT Accelerated Program.
I'm originally from Tokyo, Japan, and moved to the United States on August 26th, 2016. The first place I live in the U.S. is Ferndale, Michigan.
And now, I'm living in Cincinnati, Ohio, since August 19th, 2018.

My name is hard to pronounce for many people, but it is like this, so if you have a chance, let's try!: TA-koo-roh FOO-koo-duh


### What is your job history?
tl;dr: In Japan, I'm working as a sole proprietor also employed as a full-stack full-time engineer. In the U.S., I'm just a student. Yes, I'm following the local law, of course.

I had start programming when I was 10 years old with HotSoup Processor. When I was 13 years old, I got a 2012 MacBookPro and started PHP and JavaScript programming as my hobby.
When I was 15, I got employed by one mid-large size IT corporation as a part-time engineer.
When I was 18, I established one company with my friend call "Prema, Inc." in Tokyo. I became a co-founder, executive, and CTO.
And my job history is not ended yet; I will add more information once I got something notable.

### How to get in touch with or reach you?
Here have several methods to reach me:

### Which language do you speak?
I'm currently can speak a few languages.
| Name in English | Name | Proficiency |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Japanese | Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (or say „Å´„Åª„Çì„Åî) | Native |
| English | English | Advanced *1 |
| Spanish | Espa√±ol | Beginner |

*1: At least I could finish Bachelor's degrees and complete some interns while I'm attending UC in the U.S.

### What are you good at?
- I'm good at programming, especially for web programming (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, NodeJS), server management, network, and information security, some kind of desktop app programming (e.g., Java, C#, et cetera) as well.
- Besides computer things, I love to travel, so I'm continuously analyzing the U.S. credit card points system, getting and maximizing those points as well.
- For IQ (WISC-IV or WISC-V) test, I've answered all questions correctly except for one last item in the verbal comprehension index and all questions but not for the last 2 or 3 in the working memory index. So for those indexes, yes, I have a pretty good score. Others? No, not good at all.

So for those things (but don't ask about how to get through the IQ test as I've never prepared for it), if you ask me something, I may be able to help you!

### What kind of software do you want to contribute?
Uh, personally, I want to contribute to the fintech system, or open-source banking/GDS system (if there have one), or the bot that behaves excellently to reduce the people's effort. Also, I'd love to contribute to the utility tool, in general.

### What kind of software have you ever made?
Since all of the below programs is have some sort of problem, it's not listed to the GitHub repos.
- Uh, this might be problematic, but I've previously done making a bot for solving homework, making report Word Document and submit it to one LMS, all automatically. Not copying the answer from any people but generates it by the program behaving like a human in the report feature. So basically, I've got A+ with almost no effort,üòÜ That means I dumped my money in to get just "credit!" Thanks to the professor who uses programming-friendly (maybe (s)he is using a template?) English context! **JUST NOTE: I've used this program after checking the instructor's policy that this program does not violate any rules. DO NOT TRY AT YOUR HOME AND IF YOU ARE STILL GO WITH THIS, DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK**)
- Also, this might be problematic, but I've also made a bot to check reservation status about one spot. Once the bot found a place, the bot will check the calendar and the user's preference. If everything looks OK, the bot automatically submits the reservation request. They control their reservation before providing the information to me, so this program is not actively worked much even though the program works well.
- One-stop server-management CLI software on one company I've worked with, and since it's bounded by NDA, I could not disclose to you what exactly does.

### What you need right now?
- Some patron as I'm a student and can't earn enough money to afford hefty college fees by myself.
- Good mentors in general. For me, UC's IT course for Bachelor Student is such an elementary, almost same as my high school IT program. So I do solitaire in the classroom, and I sometimes teach to those professorsüòÇ . (So you know, no doubt about I'm considering transferring to other challenging colleges, something like MIT, UC Berkeley, or Cornell.)
- Maybe some therapists. No one understands what am I thinking, so maybe need to dump my dark side there to improve work and study efficiency)

### What are you learning about?
- WebAuthn, FIDO2
- Some AI stuff (not put serious effort into it, yet)
- Improving security while keeping convenience
- EMV, PCI/DSS ver.3, and some ISO standards to make open-source banking software.
- Business operation (not through university course; but try to learn from the practical way)
- And many more

### How much do I commit to each project on the GitHub?
Well, you can see how much do I commit to it by referring below:

### Fun (random) thing
The below contents are a bonus from me. Not worth seeing, but it might be useful for some people.

- I was in the gifted education program because of my IT skill is exceptional also maybe because IQ is relatively high than other people?

### Some security disclosure:
I'm mainly using the secured device (e.g., YubiKey) to signing my commit, log into the service, and some encryption thing. My computer is also configured to connect smart card devices for all time I'm using that device. Furthermore, my server uses sophisticated detection technology to obfuscate my server services and secure with multi-layers/steps.
