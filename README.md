### Hi there üëã
My name is **Takuro Fukuda**. He-him-his. Born in 1999.
I'm originally from Tokyo, Japan, and moved to the United States on August 26th, 2016. The first place I live in the U.S. is Ferndale, Michigan.
And now, I'm living in Cincinnati, Ohio, since August 19, 2018.

My name is hard to pronounce for many people, but it is like this, so if you have a chance, let's try!: TA-koo-roh FOO-koo-duh.

### What is your job history?
tl;dr: In Japan, I work as a sole proprietor and a full-stack, full-time engineer. In the U.S., I'm just a student. Yes, I'm following the local law, of course.

I started programming when I was ten years old with HotSoup Processor. When I was 13 years old, I got a 2012 MacBook Pro and started PHP and JavaScript programming as my hobby.
When I was 15, I was employed by a mid-large-sized IT corporation as a part-time engineer.
When I was 18, I established one company with my friend called "Prema, Inc." in Tokyo. I became a co-founder, executive, and CTO.
My job history is ongoing; I will add more information once I get something notable.


### Which language do you speak?
I currently can speak a few languages.
| Name in English | Name | Proficiency |
| --------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Japanese | Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (or say „Å´„Åª„Çì„Åî) | Native |
| English | English | Advanced *1 |
| Spanish | Espa√±ol | Beginner |

### What are you good at?
- I'm good at programming, especially web programming (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, NodeJS), server management, network, and information security. I can also program desktop apps (e.g., Java, C#, etc.).
- Besides computer-related things, I love to travel, so I'm continuously analyzing the U.S. credit card points system, getting and maximizing those points.

### What kind of software do you want to contribute?
I want to contribute to the fintech system, or open-source banking/GDS system (if there is one), or the bot that behaves excellently to reduce people's effort. Also, I'd love to contribute to the utility tool in general.

### What kind of software have you ever made?
Since all of the below programs have some problem, it's not listed in the GitHub repos.
- Also, this might be problematic, but I've also made a bot to check the reservation status for one spot. Once the bot finds a place, it retrieves the calendar and the user's preferences. If everything looks OK, the bot automatically submits the reservation request. They control their reservation before providing the information to me, so this program is only actively used a little, even though it works well.
- I worked with one company with one-stop server-management CLI software, but because NDA binds it, I could not disclose precisely what it does.

### What are you learning about?
- WebAuthn, FIDO2
- Some AI stuff (not put serious effort into it yet)
- Improving security while keeping convenience
- EMV, PCI/DSS ver.3, and some ISO standards to make open-source banking software.
- And many more

#### Alma Mater

### Some security disclosure:
I'm mainly using the secured device (e.g., YubiKey) to sign my commit, log into the service, and do some encryption. My computer is also configured to connect smart card devices when using that device. Furthermore, my server uses sophisticated technology to obfuscate my server services and secure them with multi-layers/steps.
